Hey! My name is Gage and I’m passionate about all things technology. I built this site as a place to showcase the projects I’m working on, the skills I’m learning, and to share knowledge with others. It also serves as a personal reference — something I can look back on when revisiting past projects.

I graduated with a **B.S. in Computer Science** with an emphasis in **Cybersecurity** in May 2025, and I recently earned my **CompTIA Security+ certification**. If you can’t tell already, I’m deeply interested in cybersecurity. From a young age — whether hearing about the latest incident or watching a malware scan run on our old family computer — I’ve been fascinated by how security shapes technology.

If you’d like to learn more about me professionally, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gage-wilson-ab8858347/).
